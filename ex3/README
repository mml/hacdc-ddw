Short Version
-------------
The contents of `adders` allows you to start at step 2 in Exercise3.txt, as long
as you have iverilog and gtkwave installed.

The contents of `alu` are all set for jumping off on the ALU task.

Long Version
------------
This directory contains the file Exercise3.txt, which is a verbatim grab of the
contents of http://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php/FPGAExercise3.  All the .v files
have been extracted from it, and the typo in full_adder_4bit fixed.

The standard Makefile is in `adders`, modified as in 1.a.

The unmodified standard Makefile is in `alu`.
