Short Version
-------------
This directory allows you to start at step 2 in Exercise3.txt, as long as you
have iverilog and gtkwave installed.

Long Version
------------
This directory contains the file Exercise3.txt, which is a verbatim grab of the
contents of http://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php/FPGAExercise3.  All the .v files
have been extracted from it, and the typo in full_adder_4bit fixed.

The standard Makefile is here, modified as in 1.a.
